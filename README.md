# ps5bot

### Simple bot for purchasing a single PlayStation 5 from Walmart. Was able to reduce purchase time to 20.3 seconds. When run, this will repeatedly scrape the walmart website on a loop until the 'Out of Stock' badge is gone. Only then will the purchase script be triggered.

## Usage

### clone the repo and install dependencies

### create a .env and fill out similarly to the env-sample

## Run script

`npm run start`
